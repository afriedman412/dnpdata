  url: https://github.com/chartbeat-labs/textacy
  description: >- 
    Python library for performing a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, built on the high-performance spaCy library. With the fundamentals --- tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, etc. --- delegated to another library, textacy focuses primarily on the tasks that come before and follow after.
  contributions:
  - Improved quote detection to look for text within pairs of specific characters, instead of text between any sequential quotation mark-like characters
  - Improved accuracy of attribution and reduced false positives by expanding and adjusting window for attribution
  - Added code to prepare and standardize text for quote detection

- title: Look At Me
  url: https://github.com/afriedman412/lookatme
  date: 12-4-2023
  synopsis: >-
    A light, modular website template built on Python, Jinja2 and not much else.<br><br>

    I made <strong>Look At Me</strong> because I was having trouble figuring out how to best structure a portfolio website that could showcase projects that fell under multiple categories. For example: I wanted to have a "writing" page and a "data journalism" page, with projects formatted differently on each page. Some projects fell under both categories, but having an entry on each page for the same project didn't seem like the best approach.
    <br><br>

    <strong>Look At Me</strong> lets you build a site by filling out some YAML and maybe tweaking some Jinja code if you are feeling spicy. As a bonus, you don't need to learn a new language, or use an external service to do it!
